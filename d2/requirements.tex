\section{User Stories}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{U\arabic*.}]
	\item As Marge (counsellor), I want to bulk upload multiple filled Excel templates to the TEQ data platform so that they can be analysed and used to improve immigrant services.
	
	\item As Marge (counsellor), I want to upload different types of templates at the same time so that I can minimize the time I spend uploading data.
	
	\item As Marge (counsellor), I want to be notified of any errors in the data that I am uploading so that I can quickly fix them to prevent incorrect conclusions.
	
	\item As Carlos (coordinator), I want to see all the pre-set queries that I can use, and some helpful info about each query so that I know what it does and what I can use it for.
	
	\item As Carlos (coordinator), I want to generate basic reports from ISANS data using pre-set queries so that ISANS and TEQ can view trends and improve their services.
	
	\item As Ritu (strategist), I want to create new queries that can be saved as pre-sets so that less experienced staff can still gain insight from data and generate reports. 
	
	\item As Ritu, (strategist), I want to query data based on a list of customizable variables so that I can tailor my queries to the dataset.
	
	\item As Parker (analyst), I want direct access to the data without any abstractions so that I can do my analysis without the limitations and distractions imposed by pre-configured methods.
	
	\item As Parker (analyst), I want to compare the data gathered by the organizations with Census data on immigrants so that I can see trends in demographics, predict services that will be in high demand and help organizations meet unmet needs.
	
	\item As Parker (analyst), I want to examine the ``life cycle'' of a client in an organization so that I can track the progress of clients and better understand the reasons why some clients stop coming.
	
	\item As Jerome (co-op), I want to add new fields and their possible values to templates uploaded by the organisations, and make those fields available for analysis so that more data is available, improving the quality of insights.
