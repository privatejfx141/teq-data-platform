services offered.

I am uploading so that I can quickly fix them to prevent incorrect conclusions.

use, and some helpful info about each query so that I know what it does and what
I can use it for.

using pre-set queries so that ISANS and TEQ can view trends and improve their
services.

pre-sets so that less experienced staff can still gain insight from data and
generate reports.

abstractions so that I can do my analysis without the limitations and
distractions imposed by pre-configured methods.

U11: As Jerome (co-op), I want to add new fields and their possible values to
templates uploaded by the organisations, and make those fields available for
analysis so that more data is available, improving the quality of insights.
