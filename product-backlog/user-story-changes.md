# From v1 -> v2
We realized that it wouldn't be possible to recognize template type on the fly.
Instead, users will have to select the type of template they will be uploading.
We also learned that users won't ever need to upload multiple files with the
same type of template at the same time, so bulk upload is not needed.

Removed U9, U10 because we felt these were task that weren't able to be reasonably completely in our timeline, and important to the  use of our product to our client
