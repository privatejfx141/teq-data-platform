# Our Questions:
Will data need to be stored that is not numbers? I.e. pictures, PDFs
-Only text. Char, int, double, etc(see the iCARE template)

In what ways would you like to analyse the data? i.e. generate graphs
-They are not giving us a particular format. It should show trends with graphs and charts. Up to you to decide what is relevant. Be creative with it. They are still deciding about giving us an example of a report. TBA.

What languages would you prefer the our program be accessible to?
-English. Only people from the organizations, CCS or UTSC will access it.

What other formats would you like to import data from?
-Just the iCARE template. No other format.

Who will be generating/importing data, staff or customers?
- The secretaries from the organizations will input the data. The client fills a form(usually similar to iCARE) that will be inputted directly by a human to the program.

# Other stuff
- Anonymity means that each organization can see the specifics of their data but not other organizations. They can see generalized data of other organizations (ie no client identifiers, such as name and address). Only general data like age and approximate location will be stored in the system. In case of a data breach, they don't want the information that can identify a client to be leaked. This is one of the reasons why the organizations are hesitant of giving their data. Assume that the system won't know who is who.
- Immigrants do not use the program.
- Report formats are up to you. You can generate it however you want. An example they give was a report of the type of people that use their services. Why people come or do not come to your organization? Trends such as age, sex, etc.
- Organizations will have to to sign up with the government to create their account. The government will confirm that they are the actual organization.
- There will be multiple templates, each with a different format and purpose. I will show you the one they gave us tomorrow.
- Report is aggregated. It should not give an individual clients information but give a general statistic.
- Organizations, UTSC and CCS are the only users of the system currently. UTSC should have more information than the CCS but it should still be anonymous(ie generalized data). Our system should anonymize the data before putting it into the database (they were not very specific).

# Unanswered questions
How are users given IDs? Are they guaranteed to be unique?
In the event of conflicting data, is there a case where the resolution is obvious and we can automate? Or should we always defer to human intervention
Are your staff familiar with any query languages?
